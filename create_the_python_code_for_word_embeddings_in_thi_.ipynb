        "\n",
        "* **Import necessary libraries:** `nltk` for text processing, `numpy` for numerical operations, `cosine_similarity` from `sklearn` to calculate similarity, and `Word2Vec` from `gensim` for word embedding training.\n",
        "* **Prepare the corpus:** This function tokenizes the text data and converts it to lowercase. You'll need to replace the example data sources with your actual data.\n",
        "* **Train the word embedding model:** This code trains a `Word2Vec` model on the prepared corpus. You can adjust parameters like `vector_size`, `window`, and `min_count` based on your data and needs.\n",
        "* **Define pronoun and perception-related words:** Create lists of relevant words for analysis.\n",
        "* **Analyze word embedding relationships:** This function calculates the cosine similarity between the word embeddings of pronouns and perception words.\n",
        "* **Print the similarity scores:** This code displays the calculated similarity scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Further Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Visualize the relationships:** Use dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA to visualize the word embeddings and observe clusters and patterns.\n",
        "* **Contextual analysis:** Analyze pronoun use in different contexts within your corpus to understand how it relates to employee perceptions in those specific situations.\n",
        "* **Combine with other methods:** Integrate this analysis with sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or surveys to gain a more comprehensive understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember to adapt this code and analysis to your specific data and research questions."
